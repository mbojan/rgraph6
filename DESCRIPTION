Description: Encode network data as strings of printable ASCII characters. Implemented 
    functions include encoding and decoding adjacency matrices, edgelists, igraph, and
    network objects to/from formats 'graph6', 'sparse6', and 'digraph6'. The formats and
    methods are described in McKay, B.D. and Piperno, A (2014)
